# Big Data Systems Engineering

This repository contains coursework developed as part of a **Big Data Systems Engineering** university module.

The project consists of multiple assignments focused on understanding and applying
core big data concepts such as large-scale data processing, querying, and performance considerations.

This repository is published for **portfolio and learning demonstration purposes**.
